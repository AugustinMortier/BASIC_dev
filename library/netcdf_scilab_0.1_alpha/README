This is a small library for reading NetCDF files in Scilab.

WARNING:  It is nowhere near complete.  It only implements a 
          couple basic functions for reading data from netcdf 
          files, and I'm distributing it only because other
          people may find that useful, or (hopefully) may want
          to extend it into a full package.  Consider it an alpha.

And now for the usual disclaimer:
    The author, or authors, claim no responsibility for anything resulting 
    from the use or misuse of this software.  Use at your own risk.

I'm distributing this under the LGPL (note LGPL, not GPL) so anyone 
can use it, even within a commercial distribution, and can extend
it.  Please, if you do add extensions, send them to me, and I'm 
happy to integrate them in and add you to the credits.

Requirements:
    A dynamically built NetCDF library

    I built this package using a netcdf package built as a shared library,
    putting the .so file in the current directory.  I did this by building
    netcdf with extra C flags (-fPIC) to produce object files compatible
    with becoming linked into a .so file, then did a cc -o libnetcdf.so *.o
    to package it.  Then I copied the .so file to the package directory.
    There should be nothing stopping you from doing the same.  

    As a result, I happen to have a libnetcdf.so file for Linux
    on x86_64 (Opteron).  I can supply that to you if you wish.

    It might be possible to build using a standard static netcdf 
    library.  If you accomplish this, send me the instructions, 
    and I'll include them.

To build:
    cd scilab_netcdf_version
    scilab -nw -f sci_netcdf_builder.sce

    Or, if the netcdf.h file is not in the standard include path:
    (mine is in /array/apps/shared/include)
        CPPFLAGS='-I/array/apps/shared/include' scilab -nw -f sci_netcdf_builder.sce
    
To use in a scilab session:
    scilab -nw -f path/sci_netcdf_loader.sce

Available functions:
    At the moment, I only needed to extract data, so I've supplied
    some functions for reading some common data types from netcdf
    files.

    Opening and closing netcdf files:
        file_descriptor = netcdf_open(filename)
        netcdf_close(file_descriptor)

    Reading Data: (for getting float/doubles, integers, and strings)
        data = netcdf_getFloatVar(file_descriptor, name)
        data = netcdf_getIntVar(file_descriptor, name)
        data = netcdf_getCharVar(file_descriptor, name)
    

Example Usage: 
    # Assuming a file called R1900022_023.nc, which happens to be a data
    # file from the ARGO float project.  See:
    # 

    fd = netcdf_open('R1900022_023.nc')
    float_id    = netcdf_getCharVar(fd,  'PLATFORM_NUMBER');
    latitude    = netcdf_getFloatVar(fd, 'LATITUDE')
    longitude   = netcdf_getFloatVar(fd, 'LONGITUDE')
    pressure    = netcdf_getFloatVar(fd, 'PRES')
    temperature = netcdf_getFloatVar(fd, 'TEMP')
    netcdf_close(fd)


If you wish to extend this to support more functions, I suggest
reading the documentation for netcdf (man pages) and intersci, at:
